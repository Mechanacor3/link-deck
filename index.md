# Welcome to LINK Deck Pages

# What this is

LINK Deck is a plugin to Google Slides that makes the creation of a LINK Deck much easier. In a e-school setting, having the names of students on the first slide and then a unique copy of that slide available for each student enables one document for learning. This builds that :)

# Support

This is a bit of a side project - but I want to help! For feature requests or general support, send an email to <link-deck-support@googlegroups.com> and for advanced users, put in a Issue or Pull request via GitHub.
